# Project Constitution (v1.1)
## A. Financial Hard Cap
- Dev: ¥3,000/mo -> Stop at 90%, Lock at 100%
- Ops: ¥5,000/mo -> Stop at 90%, Lock at 100%
- CI Cap: 2,000 min/mo -> Warn 1,600, Stop 2,000 (Fail-Closed)

## B. Technical Rules
- Stateless: Truth is Git & D1 only. No LLM long-term memory.
- CI First: No merge without CI pass. No chat debugging by Boss.
- Strict Gate: SSOT writes require Claude Sonnet 4/3.7 approval.

## C. UX
- Boss uses JARVIS Console ONLY. GitHub is abstracted.
